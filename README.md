First attempt to deploy an image classifier on Android device

This project is to go through the basic process from building an image classifier using transfer learning, convert the trained model to Tensorflow Lite format, and then deploy the model for inference on a mobile device. For me this is a learning process, also, in building an Android application in Kotlin, on Android Studio.
